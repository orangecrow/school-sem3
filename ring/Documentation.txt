The task was to make a general purpose ring template class utilizing iterators of form BiRing<typename key, typenmae info>.
Additionaly a function must be provided, that will take two rings and mix them according to 3 numbers provided (nbfirst, nbsecond, reps) taking nbfirst consecutive numbers from the first ring, nbsecond consecutive numbers from the second and repeating the proocedure reps times.

Here is the interface of the template class BiRing:

	BiRing()
	~BiRing()
	BiRing(const BiRing&)
	BiRing(const BiRing&&)
	BiRing& operator=(BiRing&)

	Iterator begin()
	returns Iterator pointing to an element in the ring or NULL if ring is empty

	std::vector<Iterator> search(key) 
	returns array of Iterators that point to nodes of given key

	void add(key,info)
	adds a node with key and info to the ring (after the first element)
	
	void rm_all()
	removes all nodes

	void print_all()
	prints all the nodes


Here is the interface of the type Iterator in the BiRing namespace:

	Package* operator->()
	package operator*()
	the value of returned package in case of the iterator pointing to NULL is undefined
	package is a simple structure containing:
		Key k
		Info i

	bool isnull()
	returns true if iterator pionts to NULL and false otherwise

	bool operator==()
	bool operator!=()
	Iterator& operator++()
	Iterator& operator--()
	Iterator operator++(int)
	Iterator operator--(int)

	bool print()
	prints key and info of Iterator

	bool add(key,info)
	adds a node with key and info after a node pointed to by iterator

	bool rm()
	removes node pointed to by Iterator 

	int modKey(key)
	int modInfo(info)
	modifies info or key (respectively) of a node pointed to by Iterator
	
In addition to that, functions with the return type of int or bool, return 0 or false on success and some other integer value or true on failure (for example if iterator is pointing to null).

The testing is done by using each method at least once for each case of a ring: with 0, 1, or more than one elements. Then two rings are created for the purppose of testing the shuffle function and returned ring is printed.
