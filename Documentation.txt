		Sequence
Sequence is supposed to be a class template of a single linked list
the following are the public methods:

    Sequence()
  constructor
  
	Sequence(const Sequence&)
  copyconstructor
  
	Sequence& operator=(const Sequence&)
  assigmnent operator
  
	~Sequence()
  destructor
  
	int usr_ad(val_type)
  adds node of the provided val_type after head

	int rm_val(val_type)
   removes the first node with the given val_type

	int rm_val_al(val_type)
   removes all the nodes with the given val_type

	int  usr_del()
  deletes all elements

	int pnal()print all node values
  print all node values

    int usr_cat(Sequence &a)
  copies and adds the data from the provided object

the testing in main is pretty basic. it creates variables, assigns empty lists to itself 
to check for errors. adds some static and dynamic values and prints them.


		Counter
Counter is supposed to be a class template of a linked list that stores the the keys and the number
of appearences of given keys. 

The method that is used for adding elements in this class
is usr_ad(). copy constructor and operatror= use this method.

	Counter()
   constructor

	Counter(const Counter&)
   copyconstructor

	Counter& operator=(const Counter&)
   assigmnent operator

	~Counter()
   destructor

	int pnal()
  print all node values and the count. 

	int usr_ad(key)
   looks for the key and increases the count if it exists or adds a key

	int usr_del()
	deletes all elements

	int rm_key(key)
	decreases the counter of the given key and removes the entry if its count is equal to 0.

	int rm_key_al(key a)
	removes the node with the key entirely.

	function int count_words(Counter<std::string>& cnt, std::istream& source)
	is supposed to take the istream and count the words inside the stream. 
	the implementation is rather trivial with one for loop.

	The testing is made with a txt file which can contain any set of words.
	the file is opened in main and passed to a function.
	
	in order to use the function countwords.cpp should be compiled into .o file and then added to
	main compilation.
