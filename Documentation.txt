		Sequence
Sequence is supposed to be a class template of a single linked list
the following are the public methods:

    Sequence()
  standard constructor
  
	Sequence(const Sequence&)
  standard copyconstructor
  
	Sequence& operator=(const Sequence&)
  standard assigmnent operator
  
	~Sequence()
  standard destructor
  
	node* ad(val_type, node*)
   adds node after the one that is pointed to by the pointer
  
	node* ad(val_type)
  adds node after head

	node* del(node*)
   deletes a node after the one that is pointed to by the pointer

	node* delal()
  deletes all elements

	bool pn(node*)
  print the value of the node pointed by pointer

	int pnal()print all node values
  print all node values

the testing in main is pretty basic. it creates variables, assigns empty lists to itself 
to check for errors. adds some static and dynamic values and prints them.


		Counter
Counter is supposed to be a class template that stores the the keys and the number
of appearences of given keys. 

The method that is used for adding elements in this class
is specialad(). copy constructor and operatror= use this method.

	Counter()
  standard constructor

	Counter(const Counter&)
  standard copyconstructor

	Counter& operator=(const Counter&)
  standard assigmnent operator

	~Counter()
  standard destructor

	node* ad(key, node*)
   adds node after the one that is pointed to by the pointer

	node* ad(key)
  adds node after head

	node* del(node*)
   deletes a node after the one that is pointed to by the pointer

	node* delal()
  deletes all elements

	bool pn(node*)
  print the value of the node pointed by pointer

	int pnal()
  print all node values and the count

	int specialad(key)
   looks for the key and increases the count if it exists or adds a key

	function int count_words(Counter<std::string>& cnt, std::istream& source)
	is supposed to take the istream and count the words inside the stream. 
	the execution is rather trivalr with one for loop.

	The testing is made with a test.txt file which is some random manualy typed letter strings
	the file is opened in main and passed to a function
	
	in order to use the function countwords.cpp should be compiled into .o file and then added to
	main compilation.
